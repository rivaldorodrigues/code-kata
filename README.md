## üè∑Ô∏è About

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

years divisible by 4 are leap years
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
but years divisible by 400 are leap years
Additional Notes:

Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
