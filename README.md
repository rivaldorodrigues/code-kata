## An ATM has banknotes of nominal values 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dollars.

## You can consider that there is a large enough supply of each of these banknotes.

You have to write the ATM's function that determines the minimal number of banknotes
needed to honor a withdrawal of n dollars, with
1 <= n <= 1500.

Return that number, or -1 if it is impossible.
